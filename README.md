# Data-Science-Projects

This project focuses on analyzing Food order App data to uncover insights and patterns. Using a Jupyter Notebook, various Python libraries are employed for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The project involves:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring and cleaning the dataset to understand its structure and key features.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Performing detailed analyses on different aspects of the data, such as order trends, restaurant performance, and user ratings.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations of data to highlight trends, distributions, and comparisons.

The goal is to derive actionable insights from the data to inform decision-making processes and customer behavior.

# Project 1: Swiggy Data Project

Description: Swiggy has an average of 15.8 million monthly transacting customers for its food delivery business.e average monthly active food delivery restaurant partners on Swiggy's platform have also increased by 8.7% year-on-year, from 208,000 to 226,000.You are working in a data-driven role at Swiggy. You have a dataset of customers. As a data professional, you need to analyze the data, perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and visualization, and answer the following questions:

1) What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2) How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3) What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4) Swiggy has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?
5) Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6) Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Swiggy can provide those customers with some good offers?

Used Python Libraries
        pandas                       ==> used for data manipulation and analysis.
        numpy                        ==> used for numerical operaryions.
        matplotlip.pyplot & seaborn  ==> used data visualization.
