# Data-Science-Projects

This project focuses on analyzing Food order App data to uncover insights and patterns. Using a Jupyter Notebook, various Python libraries are employed for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The project involves:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring and cleaning the dataset to understand its structure and key features.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Performing detailed analyses on different aspects of the data, such as order trends, restaurant performance, and user ratings.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations of data to highlight trends, distributions, and comparisons.

The goal is to derive actionable insights from the data to inform decision-making processes and customer behavior.

# Project 1: Swiggy Data Project

Description: Swiggy, a leading food delivery platform in India, serves an average of 15.8 million monthly transacting customers. Its active restaurant partners have grown 8.7% year-on-year, from 208,000 to 226,000. As a data professional at Swiggy, your task is to analyze customer and restaurant data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create visualizations to uncover insights that will inform business decisions.

1) What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2) How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3) What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4) Swiggy has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?
5) Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6) Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Swiggy can provide those customers with some good offers?
